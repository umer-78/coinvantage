# CoinVantage — handover / continuation notes

Owner: Umer Hashmi (`umer-78`). Live site: https://umer-78.github.io/coinvantage/
Repo: https://github.com/umer-78/coinvantage  ·  Supabase project: `cjpljmzustvgsmueqese`

A fresh session should **clone this repo, read this file, and continue from "Open work"**.

## Hard rules that never change
1. The app **never places a real trade**. The AI trader is paper/simulated only.
2. The app **never asks for private keys, seed phrases or exchange API keys**. The wallet page warns about this.
3. Wallet connection is **read-only** — `eth_requestAccounts` and `eth_chainId` only, never a signature.
4. **Accuracy is reported honestly.** Published numbers come from `tools/evaluate-engine.mjs` /
   `tools/evaluate-timing.mjs` on real data. Never round up, never quote a number that was not measured.
5. No build step, no framework, no npm runtime dependencies. Plain ES modules served from GitHub Pages.

## How to verify (always run all of these before deploying)
```
node --check $(find js -name '*.js')      # syntax
node --test tests/*.test.mjs              # 25 unit tests, incl. the missing-import guard
node tools/smoke.mjs                      # route smoke test
bash tools/deploy-github.sh               # commit + push to gh-pages
```
Then re-run the Supabase security + performance advisors and confirm zero errors.

## Open work
- [x] Whole-market AI answers on **several timeframes at once** (`scanMarketMulti`,
      `marketContextMulti` in `js/ai/context.js`; `marketMultiBlock` in `js/lib/analyst.js`).
      The assistant must answer "which coin to buy, for how long, and when to sell"
      across short term (1h) / swing (4h) / position (1d) without a coin being open.
- [x] Wording pass over the main user-facing strings (plain English, no jargon, no overselling).
- [x] Make the forecast more accurate: replace the heuristic ensemble weights in
      `js/lib/predict.js` with a stacked logistic regression over `valRecords`, add
      probability calibration, re-measure with `tools/evaluate-engine.mjs`, publish the new
      honest numbers in `TESTED_ACCURACY` and on `#/track`.
- [x] **Pooled cross-coin model — built, measured, REJECTED.** `tools/train-pooled.mjs`
      fits one logistic regression per timeframe across all 12 coins at once
      (~25k rows for 15m/1h, 22k for 4h, 14k for 1d), trained strictly on the
      first 55% of every series so it can never see a tested forecast. Wired in
      as an extra voter it scored **53.7%** against the shipped roster's 54.0%,
      Brier 0.2499 vs 0.2483, confident-subset 56.0% vs 56.9%. Per timeframe it
      helped 15m (57.1 → 58.3) and hurt 1h (53.0 → 51.8) and 4h (58.9 → 57.7) —
      differences well inside the noise for 168 forecasts each, so enabling it
      only on 15m would be fitting the test set, not an improvement.
      The trainer and `js/lib/pooled.js` are kept. To re-try it, add `pooled`
      back to `MODEL_INFO` in `js/lib/predict.js`, re-train, and re-measure —
      accept only if it beats 54.0% overall.

- [x] Chart drawing tools (trend line, horizontal, Fibonacci, erase) + VWAP and Ichimoku.
      Drawings are stored in time/price, per coin and timeframe, in the `drawings` sync key.
      Pure maths lives in `js/lib/geometry.js` so it is testable without a browser.
- [x] Final full recheck: all 18 routes walked on the live site, zero JavaScript
      errors, 25 unit tests green, Supabase advisors clean of real issues.
      Last run 2026-09-13.

## Measured numbers currently published (do not change without re-measuring)
- Forecast direction accuracy: 54.0% overall — 15m 57.1%, 1h 53.0%, 4h 58.9%, 1d 47.0%
  (672 tests, 12 coins, naive baseline 51.3%). Confident subset: 56.9% over 38% of forecasts.
  Brier 0.248. Re-measured 2026-09-12 with tools/evaluate-engine.mjs on fresh candles.
- Tried and REJECTED (all measured worse, do not re-add without new evidence):
  stacked logistic regression over the model votes (51.6%), and Platt calibration
  WITH an intercept (52.4% — the intercept moves the 50% crossing and flips
  forecasts). Slope-only calibration is what shipped: direction unchanged at
  54.0%, Brier 0.2529 to 0.2483, confident-subset accuracy 53.0% to 56.9%.
  Also rejected: a pooled cross-coin model (53.7%), and more validation points
  with below-chance models zeroed out (51.5%). Four variants tested, one shipped.
- Timing peak-hit: 61.2% vs 53.6% random — 15m 45% (worse than chance, flagged as such in the UI),
  1h 51.6%, 4h 67.9%, 1d 66.3%.
